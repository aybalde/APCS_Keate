<p><strong>Car Rental</strong></p>

<p>When you rent a car from an agency, the car is coded in the company's system with
    specific information like the following:
    license plate, make, model and year of car, and usually a special code.
    Here is an example of an algorithm to calculate a rental code using the information
    in the following way.</p>
<p><strong>Rental Code</strong> = The first 3 characters of the car's make followed by
    the first 3 characters of the car's model, the last 2 digits of the car's year, a dash,
    followed by the sum of the ASCII code value for each char of license plate and
    the final 3 digit number of the license plate. You can assume cars makes and models
    will all be words with lengths of at least 3 and license plates will all
    be formatted as three letters followed by a three digit number. You can also assume all
    cars were made after the year 2010.

</p>
For example, if a car had the following information, the rental code would be as follows:
<br>
<br><strong>Make</strong>: Toyota
<br><strong>Model</strong>: Highlander
<br><strong>Year</strong>: 2019
<br><strong>License Plate:</strong> ABC123
<br><strong>Rental Code:</strong> TOYHIG19-320
<p>
<p> The code's final 3 digit number was calculated using these steps:
    <br>1. Find the ASCII code values for A, B, and C: 65, 66, and 67.
    <br>2. Add those together with the 3 three digit number of the license plate: 65 + 66 + 67 + 123 = 320

</p>
<br>    1.	Write a program to find rental code for any given vehicle in the rental car's fleet.
Rental cars have a make, model, year, and license plate. They calculate and return the rental code as a String.

    Be sure to remember to use the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html">ASCII code</a> values of the license plate character.

<div class="hint">
    To get the 3 digit number value of the final part of the license plate (in the example, 123),
    you will need to use the static Integer method valueOf. You can find it in the Integer <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html">API</a>.

    You will need to use <strong>String</strong> methods, which can be found in its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.

2.	Verify  the program works using a car with the following information:
<p></p><style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<body>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Make</th>
        <th>Model</th>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>License Plate</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Volkswagen</td>
        <td>Beetle</td>
        <td>2015</td>
        <td>LIZ666</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
