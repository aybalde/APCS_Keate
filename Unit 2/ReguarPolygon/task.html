<p><strong>Regular Polygon</strong></p>

<p>A regular polygon is a convex polygon that has equal side lengths and angle measurements. These shapes
    have formulas to find their interior angle and exterior angle measurements and area based on their side length and
    number of sides. You can read more about regular polygons <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/regular-polygons.html">here</a>
    The formulas are as follows (assume <strong>s</strong> represents the side length and <strong>n</strong>
    represents the number of sides): </p>

<strong>interior angle measurement</strong> = (<strong>n</strong>-2)*180/<strong>n</strong>, measurement is in degrees
<br><strong>exterior angle measurement</strong> = 360/<strong>n</strong>, measurement is in degrees
<br><strong>area</strong> = (<strong>s</strong><sup>2</sup>*<strong>n</strong>)/(4tan(Pi/<strong>n</strong>))
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong>
    <br>    1.	Write a program to find the interior and exterior angles and area of a regular polygon.
    Regular polygons have a side measurement and number of sides.

<br>    2.	Verify that the program works using a regular decagon with a side length of 4.
<div class="hint">
    Deca means 10! A decagon has 10 sides.
