<p><strong>Swing Example</strong></p>

<p>Java Swing is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that has buttons, checkboxes, and more.
    It allows you to make well formatted interfaces the user can interact with. This exercise shows an example of
    a JFrame and clickable button created using classes and methods of the Swing class.
<p>

    <strong>Assignment:</strong>
    <br>1.	Explore the code to examine the code used to create a button that prints, "Hello World!" when you click it.
    <br>2.	Create a new button that says, "Click Me!"
<div class="hint">
    You will need to create a new <strong>JButton</strong> with the text, "Click Me" and set the bounds and size for it.
    Be sure your new button has a new name (otherwise the other one will not work). If needed, you can access <strong>JButton's</strong>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JButton.html">API</a>.
</div>
<br>3. Code the new button so that when it is clicked, it prints "Goodbye!" when clicked. Play around with font, style, and color to
format the printed message in the way you want. Be sure to actually change these components to see how Swing works! If you do not change
all of these components, the Check button will print "Incorrect."
<div class="hint">
    You will need to create a a new <strong>JLabel</strong> and and set the bounds and size for it. You will also need to set its font, style, size, and color.
    Be sure your new label has a new name (otherwise the other one will not work). If needed, you can access <strong>JLabel's</strong>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JLabel.html">API</a> and <strong>Font's</strong> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Font.html">API</a>.
    Your label creation will not yet create the "Goodbye!" message.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to create a a new <strong>ActionListener</strong> that tells the computer to print out "Goodbye!" when the new button is pushed.
    Be sure your new <strong>ActionListener</strong> has a new name (otherwise the other one will not work).
    You will add the <strong>ActionListener</strong> to the button you created in Step 1.
    If needed, you can access <strong>ActionListner's</strong>
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/event/ActionListener.html">API</a>.
</div>
4. Add the <strong>JButton</strong> and the <strong>JLabel</strong> to the frame.
<br>    5. Test that both buttons work as they should and that examine the difference between the two messages.
Is that what you expected given the changes you made in the message?
<br>    6..  Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.</html>
