<p><strong>Quadratic</strong></p>

<p>Every quadratic equation has 2 roots. When the equation is in the form <strong>y = ax<sup>2</sup>+ bx + c</strong>, these roots can be found using the following algorithms:
    <br>    x<sub>1</sub> = (-b + <span>&#8730;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac))</span>/(2a)
    <br>    x<sub>2</sub> = (-b - <span>&#8730;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac))</span>/(2a)

<p>

    <strong>Assignment:</strong>
    <br>    1.	Write a program to print out the roots of a quadratic equation with coefficients a, b, and c. The program should ask the user to type in values for a, b, and c.
<div class="hint">
    Java expresses imaginary numbers as <strong>NaN</strong>, meaning not a number. You can assume that is an acceptable response for imaginary roots.

<div class="hint">
    Be sure to calculate root1 using the formula for x<sub>1</sub> and root2 using the formula for x<sub>2</sub>.

    Be sure to remember to use <strong>Scanner class</strong> methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">API</a>. Also, use the correct import
    statements in the class where you use <strong>Scanner</strong> methods.

2.	Verify that the program gives the correct roots for the quadratic equation <strong>y = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 7x + 5</strong>.
<br>    3.  Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.</html>
