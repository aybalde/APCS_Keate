This repository is about Java course that i am poursuing.
I decided to share it because it seems really interesting to me.
For each unit, i have an exercise to do on my own to validate the unit.
To understand all of this, you need to have some background in programming.
If you want to learn how to program, you can check out my other course " introduction to Java ".

For this course, The main goal is to imporove yourself and create a good chunk by exercising.
I am working with "Intellij IDEA". https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html
