<p><strong>Mad Libs</strong></p>

<p>In 1953, a writer for the television show, <i>The Honeymooners</i> stumbled upon the idea of Mad Libs!
    Mad Libs is a game that asks those playing to provide different words based on their parts of speech without looking
    at a provided story. Once the words are put in the provided blanks, the story is read allowed and takes
    on a new, and often comical meaning because the provided words were given without context! You can read more about
    Mad Libs and it's creator in his <a href="http://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/grammar/parts_of_speech.html">New York Times obituary</a>.

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Use the provided Mad Libs story as your template. The story can be found <a href="https://www.woojr.com/horror-ad-libs-for-kids/night-of-the-dancing-dead-2/">here</a> .
Write a program that asks a user to input the different parts of speech, store them, and then print out the story with
the words indicating the parts of speech replaced with words provided by the user. For ease, the user will only input one
word per part of speech. The program should be able to run repeatedly so users can enter a new list of words however
many times they want to see different versions of the story with new words. Mad Libs provides parts of speech to the user,
so you will as well. To review parts of speech, you can visit this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/arts/television/leonard-b-stern-creator-of-mad-libs-dies-at-88.html#:~:text=Mad%20Libs%20was%20conceived%20in,a%20humor%20writer%2C%20happened%20by.">site</a>.

1. Fill in the constructor without parameters to prompt the user for and initialize the following variables with user input: <strong>noun,
adjective, verbEndingInING, verb, bodyPart, bodyPartPlural, color, animalPlural, beverage</strong>.
<p></p>
4. Fill in the <strong>createStory</strong> method to return the story with the blanks of the story. The story has
already been created, so you must replace parts of speech indicated with words from the user. For example, if the story
calls for a verb, fill the blank in with the user entered verb. There will be certain words that will be used more than
once (<strong>adjective, verb, color, and plural body part</strong>). For these, you <strong>must</strong> use a loop
to find and replace them.
<div class="hint">
    Use a <strong>String</strong> method to find the parts of speech in the story, which can be found in its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.
</div>
<p></p>
5. Create a loop in the client class to continue playing Mad Libs until the user enters any form of the word "no".
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    You will first need to prompt the user, then read in the user's response, trim the response, and then create the
    loop and its conditional.
</div>
6. Create a <strong>MadLibs</strong> object in the loop in the client class.
<p></p>
7. Call and print <strong>createStory</strong> in the loop in the client class to print out your story!
<p></p>
8. Prompt the user again to ask if they would like to continue playing, read in and trim their response.

9. Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
