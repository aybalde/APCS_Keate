<p><strong>Lottery</strong></p>

<p>Recall the information from our Lottery Lab. The CA Lottery has many different games you can play to win money. You buy in with a set price on an initial ticket,
    and you can either pick a set of numbers or get assigned them randomly. The price per ticket and amount of numbers
    on your ticket is determined by the game you choose to play. In general, the higher the cost of the ticket, and the
    more numbers you have to choose, the higher the prize amount. <strong>However, most numbers can only be chosen once and any combination of
        those numbers indicates a winner (the numbers do not need to be in order)!</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Write a new program to pull the random winning combination of for a lottery game. In this specific game, there are
6 total numbers that must be pulled, and each number is between <strong>10 and 60</strong>. Numbers <strong>cannot</strong> be chosen twice.
The order of the numbers on the winning ticket <strong>does not have to match</strong> the order
of the randomly chosen winning combination.
<p></p>
1. Fill in the constructor without parameters to initialize the <strong>lottoNumbers</strong>. This constructor will randomly
choose the winning number <strong>and</strong> can be used for customers who want
to have the ticket machine choose a random combination for them. <strong>Remember, the numbers chosen should be between 10 and 60.</strong>
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Remember to save <strong>lottoNumbers</strong> as a String with spaces in between each number chosen.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Be sure to remember to use <strong>Math class</strong> methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html">API</a> to randomly
    choose the numbers on the customer's ticket.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Remember that numbers <strong>cannot</strong> be repeated. You will need to use a loop here to ensure new numbers
    are randomly chosen until all of 6 numbers have been chosen.
</div>

2. Override the method, <strong>equals</strong>, to check to see if two <strong>LotteryRevisited</strong> objects are equal.
The method should take a <strong>LotteryRevisted</strong> object in as a parameter and should return true if the two lotto numbers match,
false if they do not.
<div class="hint">
    Remember <strong>order does not matter here</strong>, so you will need to use a loop to check if a number in the winning number matches
    any of the numbers in the customer's ticket.

3. Test and run your code!
