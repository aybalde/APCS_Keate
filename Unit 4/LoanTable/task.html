<p><strong>LoanTable</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you make a big purchase and choose to take out a loan, there is interest involved. This is how banks make money!
    We put our money in them to store and they pay us interest - because they are using that capital to loan money to others for these
    big purchases. The interest rate they give you to store your money is almost always lower than the interest rate they charge
    you for large loans. They make money on the difference between the amount you pay them to use their money and the amount they make
    to loan it out for big purchases. Of course, they have some capital to begin with, to protect our assets.
<p></p>What does this mean for you as the consumer - the one buying your first car or your new home? You will almost always pay more for the car or home than the
listed price over time. This is due to your interest payments, and interest matters. The higher the interest you pay, the more your overall cost
and payments will be. But how much more?

<p></p>
Often times, interest rates are compounded monthly - this is important because there a specific formula to compound interest rates
in a given period. A formula for your monthly payment, which includes part of the principal (the base price of the item) and interest is as follows:
<br><strong>    mp = (p*(ar/12)*(1+(ar/12))<sup>y * 12</sup>)/((1+(ar/12))<sup>y * 12</sup>-1)</strong>
<br>where
<br><strong>mp = monthly payment amount</strong>
<br><strong>p = principal, the price of the item</strong>
<br><strong>ar = annual interest rate</strong>
<br><strong>y = years</strong>

The table below represents a monthly payment for a given interest on a <strong>20 year</strong> loan for <strong>$25,000</strong>.

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Write a new program to compare  monthly payments based on the same price of an item as interest changes. For example,
if a person buys a new car for $40,000, what will the monthly payment be at 5% interest? 5.5%? 6%? And so on. This will help the
consumer know and understand what he or she is paying in interest and how it affects monthly payments.

1. Fill in the different parts of the <strong>printTable</strong> to print a loan table. The table should print the annual interest rate
in one column and the monthly payment in another. The method will also calculate each monthly payment. Base your loop boundary (i)
on the given rates. Doubles under zero do funny things when used as loop boundaries, so I have coded i/=100 at the beginning of
the loop and i*=100 at the end of the loop to help deal with this. <strong>Do not round or format - it is ok to get an unrounded result here.
If you round, the Check button will not work correctly.</strong>
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When used as loop boundaries, doubles round oddly. Becuase of this, the upper loop boundary should actually go past the
    high boundary for the interest rate.

    Be sure to remember to use <strong>Math class</strong> methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html">API</a> to help calculate
    the monthly payments.
</div>
<p></p>
2. Create a <strong>LoanTable</strong> object in the client class. Initialize it with the following values:
<br><strong>Item: House</strong>
<br><strong>principal = 1000000</strong>
<br><strong>low interest rate = 11</strong>
<br><strong>high interest rate = 12</strong>
<br><strong>increment amount = 0.25</strong>
<br><strong>years = 30</strong>
<p></p>
3.  Run the <strong>printTable</strong> method to test your code!
