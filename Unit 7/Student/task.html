<p><strong>Student </strong></p>

<p>Many different programs exist to store, sort and create different lists of students of schools.
    Students can be examined in many different ways through the characteristics they hold.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>You will be examining a school of students over the next two labs. In this lab, you will be focusing on the
<strong>Student</strong> class. <strong>Students</strong> have first and last names, ID numbers, GPAs, and expected graduation years.
Their GPAs are calculated from an array of chars.
<p></p>
1. Fill in the missing parts of the constructor without parameters to read in the necessary information to create a
<strong>Student</strong> object.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Read in the first name, last name, and expected graduation year of the <strong>Student</strong> from the user
    using <strong>Scanner</strong> class methods and save them in their corresponding instance variables.
    The <strong>Scanner</strong> class methods are found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">API</a>.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Remember that you need the length of an array to initialize it. After the grades have been read in as a
    <strong>String</strong> and trimmed, use some examples to see how the length of the <strong>String, grades,</strong>
    with spaces in between correspond to the number of grades or <strong>chars</strong> within that <strong>String</strong>.
    After looking at a few examples, you should see a pattern emerge. Also, remember the difference between
    <strong>integer</strong> and <strong>double</strong> division. The number of <strong>chars</strong> is the length
    of the <strong>gradesList</strong> array.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Fill the <strong>char</strong> array <strong>gradesList</strong>. Pull each <strong>char</strong> out of the
    <strong>String, grades, </strong> and put it in <strong>gradesList</strong>. You may use the <strong>String</strong>
    method <strong>charAt</strong> for this.
</div>
<p></p>
2. Complete the constructor with parameters by setting the instance variables to the values in the parameters.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Use the keyword <strong>this</strong> to help differentiate between instance variables and parameter variables.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Don't forget to call the helper method, <strong>calcGpa</strong> method to set
    <strong>gpa</strong>. Notice <strong>calcGpa</strong> has a <strong>private</strong> modifier because it is only used
    internally as a helper method. <strong>public</strong> access is not needed. Assume that it is working as intended so
    that you can use it freely.
</div>
<p></p>
3.  Fill in the getter methods for this class. There are 5 <strong>private</strong> instance variables, so there should
be 5 getter methods.
<p></p>

4. Fill in the <strong>calcGpa</strong> method, making sure to fill in the type returned and the method body.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    To calculate the GPA, you will need to traverse through the given array <strong>grades</strong> and find the average,
    given where A has a value of 4, B has a value of 3, C has a value of 2, D has a value of 1, and F has a value of 0.
    Other <strong>chars</strong> are not valid, so if another char is encountered, a warning should be printed and the
    program should be exited using a <strong>System</strong> method, which can be found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html">API</a>.
</div>
<p></p>
5. Complete the <strong>assignEmailAddress</strong> method to assign students a <strong>String</strong> email. A
student's email is formatted as follows: the first letter of the student's first name followed by the student's
last name, the student's expected graduation year, and <strong>@serrahs.com</strong>.
<p></p>
6. Write the <strong>equals</strong> method to determine whether two students are equal to each other. Two students are
equal if their first and last names are the same and if they have the same ID number.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Remember, you cannot always use <strong>==</strong> to compare to <strong>Strings</strong>.
    The <strong>String</strong> class methods are found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.
</div>
7. Make sure your name is commented near the top of your source code and use the given <strong>StudentClient</strong>
class to test the accuracy of your code. You may alter this class to fit your needs and test appropriately.
