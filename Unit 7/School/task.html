<p><strong>School</strong></p>

<p>Many different programs exist to store, sort and create different lists of students of schools.
    Students can be examined in many different ways through the characteristics they hold.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>This is the second of our two labs examining a school of students. In this lab, you will be focusing on the
<strong>School</strong> class. <strong>Schools</strong> have four different <strong>ArrayLists</strong> of
<strong>Students</strong> representing the four different classes in high school in the US.
<p></p>
1. Copy and paste the code you wrote for the <strong>Student</strong> class in the last lab to fill in the
<strong>Student</strong> class.
<p></p>
2. Fill in the missing parts of the constructor without parameters to read in the necessary information to create a
<strong>School</strong>  object.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Use a loop and a control (if) statement to determine which list to add a new <strong>Student</strong> to. If <strong>year</strong> is 1, a new
    <strong>Student</strong> would be added to <strong>year1</strong>, if <strong>year</strong> is 2, a new
    <strong>Student</strong> would be added to <strong>year2</strong>, and so on. The loop should terminate when a number
    other than 1, 2, 3, or 4 is entered. Use the no parameter <strong>Student</strong> constructor when adding a new
    <strong>Student</strong> to the list. When adding to a list, you may want to access the <strong>ArrayList</strong>
    class methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html">API</a>.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    At the end of the loop, don't forget to read in a new value for <strong>year</strong>. The <strong>Scanner</strong>
    class methods are found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">API</a>.
</div>
<p></p>
3. Complete the constructor with parameters by setting the instance variables to the values in the parameters.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Use the keyword <strong>this</strong> to help differentiate between instance variables and parameter variables.
</div>
<p></p>
4.  Fill in the getter methods for this class. There are 4 <strong>private</strong> instance variables, so there should
be 4 getter methods.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Use the <strong>alphabetizeList</strong> method before returning each list to ensure the lists are sorted.
    Assume that it is working as intended so that you can use it freely.
</div>
5. Fill in the <strong>deansList</strong> method, making sure to fill in the type returned and the method body. The
Dean's List includes all <strong>Students</strong> with a GPA of 3.75 or above.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    To create a Dean's List, you will need to create a new <strong>ArrayList</strong> to hold students with GPAs of 3.75 or
    above. Traverse through all of the <strong>ArrayList</strong> instance variables and find <strong>Students</strong>
    to add to the new list. When adding to the list, you may want to access the <strong>ArrayList</strong>
    class methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html">API</a>.
    After adding all of the eligible students to the list, sort the list using the
    <strong>alphabetizeList</strong> method. Assume that it is working as intended so that you can use it freely. Then,
    return the list.
</div>
<p></p>
6. Complete the <strong>calcSchoolAverageGpa</strong> method to find and return the average GPA of all of the students
at the school.
<div class="hint">
    To calculate the school's average GPA, you will need to traverse through the four lists, access each
    <strong>Student's</strong> GPA, and add them together. Then, divide by the total number of
    <strong>Students</strong> in the school.
</div>
<p></p>
7. Fill in the missing parts of the <strong>alphabetizeList</strong> method.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    This is done using a modified version of the <strong>selection sort</strong> found in the
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DOakHMYtig6Ms2UVupYL9BvnNzWJKYk/view?usp=sharing">Unit 7 Slideshow</a>.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    First, compare the last names of the <strong>Students</strong> at indices <strong>inner</strong>
    and <strong>min</strong>. If the <strong>lastName</strong> of the student at <strong>inner</strong> comes
    before the <strong>lastName</strong> of the student at <strong>min</strong>, <strong>min</strong> should become <strong>inner</strong>.
    If the last names of the <strong>Students</strong> at indices <strong>inner</strong>
    and <strong>min</strong> are the same, compare the <strong>firstName</strong>s.
    If the <strong>firstName</strong> of the student at <strong>inner</strong> comes
    before the <strong>firstName</strong> of the student at <strong>min</strong>, <strong>min</strong> should become <strong>inner</strong>.
    The <strong>String</strong> class methods are found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.
</div>
8. Fill in the <strong>findStudent</strong> method, making sure to fill in the type returned and the method body.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Traverse through the instance variable lists in <strong>School</strong> and compare
    each <strong>Student's</strong> ID number with <strong>id</strong>. If a <strong>Student's</strong>
    ID number matches <strong>id</strong>, return that <strong>Student</strong>. If <strong>id</strong>
    does not match anyone's in the school, return <strong>null</strong>.
</div>
<p></p>
9. Fill in the <strong>removeDoubles</strong> method to remove any <strong>Students</strong> who are doubled in any instance
variable lists. This method removes the <strong>Student</strong> objects in schools that are the same so that only one remains.
No <strong>Student</strong> objects across lists are equal. For example, there are no <strong>Student</strong> objects
in <strong>year1</strong> that are equal to <strong>Student</strong> objects in <strong>year2</strong>,
<strong>year3</strong>, or <strong>year4</strong> and there are no <strong>Student</strong> objects in
<strong>year2</strong> that are equal to <strong>Student</strong> objects in <strong>year1</strong>,
<strong>year3</strong>, or <strong>year4</strong>, and so on. This method returns a count of the number of objects that
have been removed.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Initialize a count variable at the top of the method and increase it every time you remove a doubled
    <strong>Student</strong>. Return this variable at the end of the method.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You will need a nested loop to ensure you have checked all of the <strong>Students</strong> with each other.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    When comparing <strong>Students</strong>, you will need to check two things:
    that they are not the same object (so you don't accidentally remove a singular <strong>Student</strong>)
    <strong>and</strong> that they are equal according to the
    <strong>equals</strong> method in the <strong>Student</strong> class.
    Assume that <strong>equals</strong> is working as intended so that you can use it freely.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    When removing objects from a list, you may want to access the <strong>ArrayList</strong>
    class methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html">API</a>. If you
    start from the beginning of the lists, be sure to decrement the index you are using after you remove an object so
    that you do not inadvertently skip over an object.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You need to repeat similar code through all four lists to catch doubles in all of the lists.
</div>
10. Make sure your name is commented near the top of your source code and use the given <strong>SchoolClient</strong>
class to test the accuracy of your code. You may alter this class to fit your needs and test appropriately.
