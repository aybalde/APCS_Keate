<p>When arrays are created, we sometimes want to examine them with and without certain values. It is also important to
    know how to take arrays in methods as parameters and return them. This lab practices both of these skills.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Write a program that has a method that takes in an array of integers and returns a new array with all of the zeroes removed.
The program will create the original array in the tester class rather than in the constructor. Examine the following arrays.
<p></p>
Original Array:
<p></p><style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<body>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>0</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>0</th>
        <th>0</th>
        <th>5</th>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
<p></p>
The new array resulting from running the method <strong>removeZeroes</strong> would be the following.
<p></p>
Array returned by <strong>removeZeroes</strong>:
<p></p><style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<body>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>5</th>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
<p></p>
1. Code the <strong>removeZeroes</strong> method to take in an array and return a new array with the zeroes removed.
<div class="hint">
    Remember to declare a new array of <strong>ints</strong> and return that array. To help find the size of the array, you will
    need a loop to count the zeroes. You will not know the length of the array in the parameter, so you will need to use the
    variable <strong>length</strong> here.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Remember to use a loop fill the new array with all values but zeroes.
</div>
2. Create an array and fill it with the following values:
<br><strong>0, 1, 3, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 13, 25, 0</strong>
<p></p>
3. Run the <strong>removeZeroes</strong> method, and <strong>save the resulting array</strong>. Then, print the original array and the new array resulting from the <strong>removeZeroes</strong> method.
Test your method with many different arrays to make sure it works as intended.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Remember the <strong>removeZeroes</strong> method is static, so it needs to be called on the class, not the object.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Remember when a method returns something, you need to create a variable to save it to if you want it saved.
    Otherwise, it will be returned and immediately picked up by the trash collector.
</div>
4. Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
