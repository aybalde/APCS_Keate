<p><strong>Mad Libs Revisited</strong></p>

<p>Recall the information from the MadLibs Lab. In 1953, a writer for the television show, <i>The Honeymooners</i> stumbled upon the idea of Mad Libs!
    Mad Libs is a game that asks those playing to provide different words based on their parts of speech without looking
    at a provided story. Once the words are put in the provided blanks, the story is read allowed and takes
    on a new, and often comical meaning because the provided words were given without context! You can read more about
    Mad Libs and it's creator in his <a href="http://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/grammar/parts_of_speech.html">New York Times obituary</a>.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    In the <strong>MadLibs Lab</strong>, the user only provided you with one of the parts of speech to fill in for
all values of that part of speech. For example, you only took in one adjective, but you filled in that adjective 4 times
because it appeared 4 times. This time, you will be asking the user for different values for each part of speech. For
example, if your story has 4 adjectives, you will ask the user for 4 adjectives and use each of them once.
<p></p>
Use the provided Mad Libs story or one found <a href="https://www.woojr.com/printable-mad-libs-for-kids/">here</a> as your template. Each story gives different options of words one must provide.
Write a program that asks a user to input different parts of speech as they are written and then print out the story with
the words provided by the user. The program should be able to run repeatedly so users can enter a new list of words however
many times they want to see different versions of the story with new words. Mad Libs provides parts of speech to the user,
so you will as well. To review parts of speech, you can visit this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/arts/television/leonard-b-stern-creator-of-mad-libs-dies-at-88.html#:~:text=Mad%20Libs%20was%20conceived%20in,a%20humor%20writer%2C%20happened%20by.">site</a>.
<p></p>
1. Fill in the constructor without parameters to initialize the following arrays: <strong>nouns, pluralNouns, verbs, verbs ending in ing, adjectives, adverbs, interjections, places, body parts</strong>, and any other blanks the story asks for.
<strong>Be sure to delete any instance variable arrays you do not need.</strong> We should not have instance variables we do not
need in our programs.
This constructor will initialize the arrays' size to the number of each part of speech blank in your provided Mad Lib.
For example, if there are 6 verbs, the array for verbs should be of length 6. Then, fill each array with user input for
each of the words. This will allow for the user to have full control of what to enter!
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Use a loop to fill each array with user input.
</div>
<p></p>
2. Fill in the following methods to print out the contents of each list: <strong>printNouns, printPluralNouns, printVerbs, printVerbsEndingInING, printAdjectives, printAdverbs,
    printAdverbs, printInterjections, printPlaces, printBodyParts</strong>, and other print methods to print out any other list of blanks your story asks for.
Make sure this is formatted nicely so it is easy for the user to read. Notice these methods are <strong>private</strong> methods. They are helper methods to the method <strong>printLists</strong>, so
they do not need to be declared <strong>public</strong>.
<p></p>
3.  Fill in the <strong>printLists</strong> methods to print out all of the lists with one method call. Make sure this is formatted nicely so it is easy for the user to read.
<div class="hint">
    Remember to call the methods you just created in this method!
</div>
<p></p>
4. Fill in the <strong>createStory</strong> method to return the story as a <strong>String</strong> with the blanks of the story filled
in with the user input from the specified lists. For example, if the story calls for a verb, fill the blank in with a
verb from the user entered verb list.
<div class="hint">
    Use a <strong>String</strong> method to find the parts of speech in the story, which can be found in its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to go through each list once it is filled to access the user entered data.
</div>
<p></p>
5. Create a loop in the client class to continue playing Mad Libs until the user enters any form of the word "no".
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    You will first need to prompt the user, then read in the user's response, trim the response, and then create the
    loop and its conditional.
</div>
6. Create a <strong>MadLibsRevisited</strong> object in the loop int the client class.
<p></p>
7. Call <strong>printLists</strong> in the loop in the client class to print all of the user input, making sure the words is entered in the correct list.
<p></p>
8. Call <strong>createStory</strong> in the loop in the client class to print out your story!
<p></p>
9. Prompt the user again to ask if they would like to continue playing, read in and trim their response.

10. Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
