<p><strong>Movie Theatre Sale</strong></p>

<p>When you go to the movies, there are various tickets you can buy. For example, only those 17 and over can purchase a
    rated R movie ticket. Additionally, discounts are usually given to children and seniors and for matinee showings.
<p>

    <strong>Assignment:</strong>
    <br>    Write a program to have a movie theatre cashier prompt the user and calculate the total sale of a set of movie tickets.
    <p> 1. Fill in the constructor to ask the customer for the title of the movie, rating of the movie, the time of the movie, and the number and type of tickets.
<div class="hint">
    Be sure to remember to use <strong>Scanner class</strong> methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">API</a>. Also, use the correct import
    statements in the class where you use <strong>Scanner</strong> methods.

<div class="hint">
    The time needs to be converted to military time to easily distinguish between AM and PM. 2:00pm in military time is
    entered as 14:00 but must be saved as 1400.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You should check the time and determine if the show is a matinee showing (before 2:00pm).
    If so, the total number of tickets should also be the total number of matinee tickets as this is the cheapest discount.
    The rest of the types of tickets should be set to zero (you will not need to ask the user how many of each type of these there are).
    For any showing after 2:00pm, the number of matinee tickets should be set to zero and you will need to ask for the number of
    each type of ticket.
</div>
<br>2.  Create a method, <strong>checkID</strong>, that records the customer's ID age is valid if the movie is rated R.
The user should be asked to enter the birth year on the ID to test if the ID is valid. This method should return a boolean.
<div class="hint">
    You will be using this method in the client class to determine whether or not to proceed with the sale.
</div>
<br> 3. Write a method, <strong>getTotalSale</strong>, to calculate and return the total sale for tickets for a customer. The sale should account for appropriate discounts when necessary.
<br> 4. Fill in the client class being sure to run the <strong>checkID</strong> method to make sure only those over 17 can buy tickets to rated R movies. If someone under 17 tries to buy a ticket,
a message should be printed, indicating the sale is over, and the program should terminate.
<div class="hint">
    An example of how to terminate a program is shown in the constructor.
</div>
<br> 5. Verify that the program gives the correct sale for the following information. The birth year of the customer is 2000.
<br><strong>Movie:</strong> Schindler's List
