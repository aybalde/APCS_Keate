<p><strong>Lottery</strong></p>

<p>The CA Lottery has many different games you can play to win money. You buy in with a set price on an initial ticket,
    and you can either pick a set of numbers or get assigned them randomly. The price per ticket and amount of numbers
    on your ticket is determined by the game you choose to play. In general, the higher the cost of the ticket, and the
    more numbers you have to choose, the higher the prize amount.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Write a program to pull the random winning combination of for a lottery game. In this specific game, there are
6 total numbers that must be pulled, and each number is between 1 and 100. Numbers can be chosen twice.
The order of the numbers on the winning ticket <strong>must</strong> match the order
of the randomly chosen winning combination.
<p></p>
1. Fill in the constructor without parameters to initialize the <strong>lottoNumbers</strong>. This constructor will randomly
choose the winning number <strong>and</strong> can be used for customers who want
to have the ticket machine choose a random combination for them.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    Remember to save <strong>lottoNumbers</strong> as a String with spaces in between each number chosen. There should be
    no leading or trailing spaces.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Be sure to remember to use <strong>Math class</strong> methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html">API</a> to randomly
    choose the numbers on the customer's ticket.
</div>
<p></p>
2. Fill in the constructor with parameters to initialize the customer's lotto ticket. This constructor will allow
customers to choose their own combination.
<div class="hint">
    Remember to save <strong>lottoNumbers</strong> as a String with spaces in between each number chosen. There should be
    no leading or trailing spaces.
</div>
3.  Create the necessary getter method to make sure <strong>lottoNumbers</strong> is accessible outside of the <strong>Lottery</strong>
    class.
<p></p>
4. Override the method, <strong>equals</strong>, to check to see if two <strong>Lottery</strong> objects are equal.
The method should take a <strong>Lottery</strong> object in as a parameter and should return true if the two lotto numbers match,
false if they do not.
<div class="hint">
    Remember order matters here, so the numbers will have to match completely.
</div>
5. Write the method <strong>checkTicket</strong> to print the whether or not the customer's ticket is a winner.
The method should take a <strong>Lottery</strong> object in as a parameter.
<div class="hint">
    You should use the <strong>equals</strong> method you just wrote in this method.
</div>
<p></p>
6. First, enter the main method into the LotteryClient class. Then, verify that the program works by creating a <strong>Lottery</strong> object <strong>customerTicket</strong> and another
<strong>Lottery</strong> object <strong>winningCombo</strong> and running the
<strong>checkTicket</strong> method in the <strong>LotteryClient</strong> class. The output window should clearly display
the customer's lottery ticket combination and the winning combination as well as whether or not the ticket is a winner.
<p></p> 7. Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
