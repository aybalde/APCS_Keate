<p><strong>Coins</strong></p>

<p>Some registers have change machines that automatically
    dispense coins using the fewest amount of coins possible.
    This lab will investigate algorithm in the machinery.
    You should use integer math to solve this problem.<p>
<p>Example: 41 cents: Quarter(s) 1, Dime(s) 1, Nickel(s) 1, Penny(s) 0</p>

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    1.	Write a program to find the number and types of coins dispensed by a change machine.
<br>	2. The program should display the fewest amount of coins possible.
<br>	3. Verify that the program gives the correct type and amount of coins for 94 cents.
<br>    4.  Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
