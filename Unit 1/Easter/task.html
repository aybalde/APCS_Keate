<p><strong>Easter</strong></p>

<p>An algorithm for finding the date of Easter in a given year was created in 1876
    and was published in Butcher’s Ecclesiastical Handbook. This algorithm holds
    for any year in the Gregorian calendar, which means years including and after 1583.
    Subject to small changes, the algorithm is as follows:<p>

1. Start with the year and call it <strong>year</strong>.
    <br>2.	Divide <strong>year</strong> by 19 and call the remainder <strong>a</strong>. Ignore the quotient.
    <br>3.	Divide <strong>year</strong> by 100 and get a quotient <strong>b</strong> and
    a remainder <strong>c</strong>.
    <br>4.	Divide <strong>b</strong> by 4 and get a quotient <strong>d</strong>
    and a remainder <strong>e</strong>.
    <br>5.	Divide <strong>b</strong> + 8 by 25 and get a quotient <strong>f</strong>. Ignore the remainder.
    <br>6.	Divide <strong>b</strong> – <strong>f</strong> + 1 by 3 and get a quotient
    <strong>g</strong>. Ignore the remainder.
    <br>7.	Divide 19 * <strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong> – <strong>d</strong> – <strong>g</strong>
    + 15 by 30 and get a remainder <strong>h</strong>. Ignore the quotient.
    <br>8.	Divide <strong>c</strong> by 4 and get a quotient <strong>i</strong>
    and a remainder <strong>k</strong>.
    <br>9.	Divide 32 + 2 * <strong>e</strong> + 2 * <strong>i</strong> - <strong>h</strong>
    - <strong>k</strong> by 7 and get a remainder <strong>r</strong>. Ignore the quotient.
    <br>10.	Divide <strong>a</strong> + 11 * <strong>h</strong> + 22 * <strong>r</strong>
    by 451 and get a quotient <strong>m</strong>. Ignore the remainder.
    <br>11.	Divide <strong>h</strong> + <strong>r</strong> - 7 * <strong>m</strong> + 114
    by 31 and get a quotient <strong>n</strong> and a remainder <strong>p</strong>.
<p>The value of <strong>n</strong> gives the month (3 for March and 4 for April) and the value of  <strong>p + 1</strong>
    gives the day of the month. For example, if <strong>year</strong> is 2003:

    <br>a = 8
    <br>b = 20
    <br>c = 3
    <br>d = 5
    <br>e = 0
    <br>f = 1
    <br>g = 6
    <br>h = 26
    <br>i = 0
    <br>k = 3
    <br>r = 3
    <br>m = 0
    <br>n = 4
    <br>p = 19</p>
    <p>In 2003, Easter fell on April 20 (month = <strong>n</strong> = 4
        and day = <strong>p</strong> + 1 = 20).</p>

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    1.	Write a program to solve for the day that Easter falls on
    for a given year.
<br>    2.	Verify that the program gives the correct date of Easter for the 2021.
<br>    3.  Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.

<div class="hint">
  The date of Easter in 2021 is April 4th.

<div class="hint">
    Pay attention to exactly what each variable should hold.
